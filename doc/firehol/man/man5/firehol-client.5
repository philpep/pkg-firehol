.SH NAME
.PP
firehol\-client \- client command
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
{ client | client46 } \f[I]service\f[] \f[I]action\f[]
[\f[I]rule\-params\f[]]
.PP
client4 \f[I]service\f[] \f[I]action\f[] [\f[I]rule\-params\f[]]
.PP
client6 \f[I]service\f[] \f[I]action\f[] [\f[I]rule\-params\f[]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[C]client\f[] subcommand defines a client of a service on an
interface or router.
Any \f[I]rule\-params\f[] given to a parent interface or router are
inherited by the client, but are reversed.
.PP
For FireHOL a client is the source of a request.
Even though this is more complex for some multi\-socket services, to
FireHOL a client always initiates the connection.
.PP
The \f[I]service\f[] parameter is one of the supported service names
from firehol\-services(5).
Multiple services may be specified, space delimited in quotes.
.PP
The \f[I]action\f[] can be any of the actions listed in
firehol\-actions(5).
.PP
The \f[I]rule\-params\f[] define a set of rule parameters to further
restrict the traffic that is matched to this service.
See firehol\-params(5) for more details.

\f[B]Note\f[]
.PP
Writing \f[C]client4\f[] is equivalent to writing \f[C]ipv4\ client\f[]
and ensures this subcommand is applied only in the IPv4 firewall rules.
.PP
Writing \f[C]client6\f[] is equivalent to writing \f[C]ipv6\ client\f[]
and ensures this subcommand is applied only in the IPv6 firewall rules.
.PP
Writing \f[C]client46\f[] is equivalent to writing \f[C]both\ client\f[]
and ensures this subcommand is applied in both the IPv4 and IPv6
firewall rules; it cannot be used as part an interface or router that is
IPv4 or IPv6 only.
.PP
The default \f[C]client\f[] inherits its behaviour from the enclosing
interface or router.
