.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[C]mark\f[] helper command sets a mark on packets that can be
matched by traffic shaping tools for controlling the traffic.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note\f[]
.PP
To set a mark on whole connections, see
firehol\-connmark(5).
There is also a \f[C]mark\f[] parameter which allows matching marks
within individual rules (see firehol\-params(5)).
.RE
.PP
The \f[I]value\f[] is the mark value to set (a 32 bit integer).
.PP
The \f[I]chain\f[] will be used to find traffic to mark.
It can be any of the iptables(8) built in chains belonging to the
\f[C]mangle\f[] table.
The chain names are: INPUT, FORWARD, OUTPUT, PREROUTING and POSTROUTING.
The names are case\-sensitive.
.PP
The \f[I]rule\-params\f[] define a set of rule parameters to match the
traffic that is to be marked within the chosen chain.
See firehol\-params(5) for more details.
.PP
Any \f[C]mark\f[] commands will affect all traffic matched.
They must be declared before the first router or interface.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note\f[]
.PP
If you want to do policy based routing based on iptables(8) marks, you
will need to disable the Root Path Filtering on the interfaces involved
(rp_filter in sysctl).
